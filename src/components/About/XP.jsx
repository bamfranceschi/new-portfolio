    "Most recently, I've had the opportunity to intern with Connect Our Kids as
    a Team Lead. Connect Our Kids helps social workers locate relatives of
    foster children faster, with the aim of finding a permanent home for these
    children. As Team Lead, I led a team of five student developers as we built
    out the mobile app functionality in ReactNative using TypeScript. In
    addition to my internship, I've listed other projects I've worked on in my
    project section. <br />
    <br /> <br />
    Prior to becoming a web dev, I co-founded FamFi, a startup focused on
    solving modern complexities of couples' finances. I watched my co-founder
    build our mobile app from the ground up (using ReactNative & GraphQL), and
    knew right then that I wanted to learn how to build beautiful, functional
    and impactful products with code. <br /> <br />
    Before tech, my passions found me working for an Austin-based nonprofit,
    Circle of Health International, as the Chief Development Officer. The
    organization specializes in securing and supporting maternal and newborn
    healthcare initiatives in crisis settings, such as natural disasters and
    conflict zones.
